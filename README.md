# Telecommunication_Company_Churn_Project

Customer churn in the telecomunication industry

In this project, machine learning models are made to predict possible customer churn in a telecomunication industry. Our models are powerful which can determine churn factors and we can give a company the advantage of taking action before losing customers.

Business Problem
1.	What are the most important factors affecting the customer churn?
2.	What are the factors which are increasing churn in the compnany?
3.	What are the factors that decrese churn and therefore retain customers in the company?

Data
The data used is derived from the following file "bigml_59c28831336c6604c800002a.csv" found in this repository. The machine learning modelling results can be found in the following file Customer_Churn_Model.ipynb" found in this repository. The presentation of the results can be found in a pdf file as "CustomerChurn_presentation.pdf"

Methods
OSEMN approach is used in this project. The data is , scrubbed, cleaned, explored, visualized, modelled and interpreted.

Differnt machine learning models were used to examine the most precise and accurate one including Random Forest, DescisionTree and SVM Classifiers ...ect.

Results and Conclusion
Our models produced were able to predict up tp 65-100% true churn.

The top five factors contributing to churn in the company are :

1.	Total day charge
2.	Customer service calls
3.	Total evening charge
4.	Total internaional charge

Top factors contributing to retention of customers are :

1.	Having a voice mail plan
2.	Having no international paln
